## Models

Here are some examples of what we might expect our data types to look like on the wire as JSON.

i.e. If we have a python object and call object.to_json() on them, we might expect output like so.
Or this is what the API might expect to receive in an HTTP POST from a client side form.

We have to determine as a team what fields we want to accomplish what goals we set.  This means
everyone should be able to both refer to these objects, but also please feel free to make changes.
